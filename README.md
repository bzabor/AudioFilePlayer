# AudioFilePlayer
An audio player plugin that can be used for testing/development in the JUCE 5.4.5 AudioPluginHost


This is a JUCE framework audio plugin that can be added to the audio plugin host, 
based on the one created by another user here:

https://github.com/jonathonracz/AudioFilePlayerPlugin

That version wouldn't compile on Projucer 5.4.5. This version does, though I do
not vouch for the code quality - I just did what seemed necessary to get it 
working :)
